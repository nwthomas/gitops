> NOTE: This repository is currently in a state of flux as I finalize details of my cluster and slowly both learn and also move to different architectural patterns. In particular, the Helm and Terraform files will likely be drastically updated later as I migrate files and (eventually) bring [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io) online for applying Terraform changes.

# GitOps

## üîé About

This repository contains ArgoCD, Helm, and Terraform files for declarative deployments with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), specifically [k3s](https://k3s.io/).

You can use these files to stand up your own on-prem Kubernetes cluster. While this repository was built to be run on Raspberry Pi devices, it should be equally valid anywhere Kubernetes can run.

If you want to implement this for yourself, please follow the [setup document](./docs/SETUP.md) (which is actively being updated).

## üéñÔ∏è Features

- App-of-apps: A root Argo CD Application deployment schema which recursively manages child apps
- Namespace deployments: `argocd`, `cert-manager`, `kube-system`, `logging`, `longhorn-system`, `monitoring`, and `applications-eng`
- Cert-manager: X.509 certificate management for Kubernetes
- Longhorn: Distributed on-prem file storage with multiple storage classes
- Metal LB: An on-prem native software load balancer
- Monitoring: Prometheus Operator with Grafana using storage PVC through Longhorn
- n8n: Workflow automation platform with persistent storage
- Dashboard UI for:
    - Argo CD: For controlling deployments and rollbacks
    - Grafana: For building dashboards against Prometheus data
    - Longhorn: For controlling the distributed block storage setup
    - n8n: For creating and managing automated workflows
    - Prometheus: For querying against raw data from pods/nodes/deployment resources

## üß± Project Management

Work for this repository is housed in this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/HOJMq7WP/gitops).

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

### Hardware

The cluster this repo's files runs on uses Raspberry Pi 5 devices, specifically the 16gb version.

Here's the hardware list of what each of the control/worker nodes is using:
1. [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSPYPKRG)
2. [NVMe + POE+ Pi 5 Hat and Active Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8JC3MXQ)
3. [Samsung 2TB NVMe SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHLCRF91)
4. [256gb Micro SD Card](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TJZDJ4D)

> It's worth noting that one of my nodes is a computer running Ubuntu with a nice GPU, but that's really outside the scope of any guides I'd give for deploying this repository. The only part of this that will impact you is any apps that have node affinity for that setup, but you can easily remove that from your own deployments.
>
> The rest of the nodes are Raspberry Pi 5s as described above.
